description: Reactor vessel head degradation at Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station
  in Oak Harbor, Ohio, in 2002. One contributing factor to this corrosion incidence
  is the leakage of borated water which serves as the reactor coolant. Due to this
  incidence, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission heightened its regulatory oversight
  of Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. In light of the raising awareness of nuclear
  safety, students learn the fundamental material science behind the design of a nuclear
  power system in this course. This image is in the public domain.

  caption: This six-inch cavity in a reactor vessel head, caused by corrosion from
    leaking reactor coolant (borated water), was [discovered at the Davis-Besse Nuclear
    Power Station](http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/vessel-head-degradation/overview.html)
    in 2002. Metal corrosion is one of many materials science considerations in designing
    and operating nuclear power systems. (This image by the [U.S. NRC](http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/vessel-head-degradation/images.html)
